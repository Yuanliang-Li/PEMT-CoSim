# PEMT-CoSim

A Co-Simulation Platform For Packetized Energy Management and Trading

## 1. Description
PEMT-CoSim is a co-simulation platform for packetized energy management (PEM) and trading (PET) in smart grids. It is developed based on the open-source [Transactive Energy Simulation Platform (TESP, v1.0.0)](https://tesp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/TESP_Overview.html#). 


Packetized Energy (PE) is a grid management technology that breaks the power into a fixed-duration/fixed power "energy packet" with a "request-reply" scheme. Prosumers (both supplier and consumer) can request a packet for their load/generator to consume/provide. A central coordinator will accept/reject the request based on grid conditions. There are two types of PE, Packetized Energy Management (PEM) and Packetized Energy Trading (PET). Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a load dispatch program that uses a PEM controller to have houses' flexible load to request a packet with a probability, and the central coordinator will accept/reject the request by comparing the request load with a balancing signal. PET allows prosumers to bid for a packet in a double-auction market. The cleared price and quantity determine whether bids are accepted or rejected for prosumers. 

PEMT-CoSim utilizes the TESP's HELICS co-simulation framework to enable coordination between a number of dedicated simulators/programs (named "federate" under the HECLIS framework): GridLAB-D federate (distribution system simulator),  PyPower federate (transmission system simulator), EnergyPlus federate(building simulator), Wether federate (weather data generator), Substation federate (Implemented the processes for PET and PEM).

The Substation is the main federate which implements the PEM and PET using developed API, including PEM-related modules (PEM Controllers, PEM Coordinator), and PET-related modules (PET Prosumer, PEM Market). Moreover, the AI modules implemented the reinforcement learning algorithm that can be used to optimize the bidding strategies for prosumers.


## 2. Installation
PEMT-CoSim runs natively on Linux. However, for better deployment of this project,  it is suggested to run this project in a docker container. Therefore, PEMT-CoSim can also run in Windows and MacOS via docker. 

### 2.1 Installation via Docker 
Before the installation, the [Docker or Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) should be installed. 

- Clone the PEMT-CoSim Project from GitHub (https://github.com/Yuanliang-Li/PEMT-CoSim)
    > git clone https://github.com/Yuanliang-Li/PEMT-CoSim.git
    >
- Open a command prompt in Linux/Windows/MacOS, and cd into the "docker" directory of the PEMT-CoSim project.
    > cd docker
    >
- Build docker image
    > docker build . -t ubuntu-vnc
    >
- Build ubuntu docker container
    > docker run -it --privileged -p 2222:22 -p 5951:5901 --mount type=bind,source= /YOURDIRECTORY/To/PEMT-CoSim,destination=/PEMT-CoSim --name ubuntu-pemt ubuntu-vnc
    >
    When the 'docker run' command runs, the container starts and executes a startup .sh script that will set up the environment for development. \
    The "--mount" option can make a file or directory on the host machine mounted into the container. So, after the installation, you can develop/edit/post-process your project on your host machine and run the co-simulation in the container.
- Install TESP by typing when building the container
    > /root/startup/tesp-1.0.0-linux-x64-installer.run
    >
    After this step, you have now installed the PEMT-CoSim.

The following steps show how you start and connect to your running container
- Start the container (the container will run)
    > docker start ubuntu-pemt
- Connect to a running docker container
    > docker exec --privileged -it ubuntu-pemt /bin/bash
